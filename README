== Invoice number generating for ActiveRecord

The problem this gem tries to solve is that for bookkeeping, an uninterrupted sequence of
invoice numbers is needed. There are, however, situations in which the database's auto
incrementing id field won't do. For example:

* Orders for a webshop should only get an invoice number if the order is actually paid.
* The order in which record are made is different from the order in which invoices are
  created, for example in case of a reservations system.

This gem makes this stupid simple:

    # as soon as order is paid, invoice_nr will be set
    class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_invoice_number :invoice_nr, assign_if: ->(order) { order.paid? }
    end

    # manually assign an invoice number when the user finishes the reservation
    class Reservation < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_invoice_number :invoice_nr

        def finish
            assign_invoice_number
            save
        end
    end

    # both funky order and boring order will share the same sequence of invoice numbers
    class FunkyOrder < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_invoice_number :invoice_nr, assign_if: ->(order) { order.paid? }, invoice_number_sequence: :order
    end
    class BoringOrder < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_invoice_number :invoice_nr, assign_if: ->(order) { order.paid? }, invoice_number_sequence: :order
    end

That's it. This gem could use some more flexibility and support for NoSQL databases, but
hopefully it is usefull to some people as is.
